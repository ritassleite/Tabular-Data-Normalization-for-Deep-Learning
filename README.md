# Tabular Data Normalization for Deep Learning

Due to the heterogeneity and disparity in distribution of its features, tabular data presents a unique challenge to Deep Learning methods, which are highly sensitive to the scale and ordering of the input. To bridge this gap and ensure as table learning process, normalization techniques are key. 
This repository contains an analysis of different normalization techniques and their impact on Deep Learning models, in particular in the Fraud Detection Field.
